# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner [[Demo]](https://nst-dev.000webhostapp.com/tools/scanner.php)
This is a simple web application vulnerability scanner that checks if a given URL or IP address is vulnerable to common web application security vulnerabilities. The tool is designed to help website owners and security researchers identify vulnerabilities in their web applications that can be exploited by attackers.

## How it works
The scanner uses regular expressions to search for common web application vulnerabilities in the HTML code of the target website. If a vulnerability is found, the tool displays a table of results indicating if it is vulnerable and to which vunlrabilties.

## The scanner checks for the following 36 vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability             | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| SQL Injection             | This occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into an application's input which is then executed by the database. |
| XSS                       | This occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page, which are then executed by unsuspecting users. |
| File Inclusion            | This occurs when unsanitized user input is used to load a file or resource that should not be publicly accessible. |
| Directory Traversal       | This occurs when user input is used to navigate to directories outside of the intended directory hierarchy. |
| Remote File Inclusion     | This occurs when malicious code is included from a remote server, allowing an attacker to execute code on the server. |
| Command Injection         | This occurs when user input is passed directly to the command line, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. |
| Cross-Site Request Forgery | This occurs when an attacker submits unauthorized requests on behalf of an authenticated user. |
| Unrestricted File Upload  | This occurs when malicious files are uploaded to a server and executed, allowing an attacker to execute code on the server. |
| Password Cracking         | This occurs when weak password policies allow attackers to guess or crack passwords. |
| Session Hijacking         | This occurs when an attacker gains access to a user's session ID and uses it to impersonate the user. |
| Broken Authentication and Session Management | This occurs when poorly implemented authentication and session management allow attackers to bypass authentication and hijack sessions. |
| Remote Code Execution     | This occurs when user input is passed directly to the command line, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. |
| Local File Inclusion      | This occurs when unsanitized user input is used to load a file or resource that should not be publicly accessible. |
| Server Side Request Forgery | This occurs when an attacker sends requests to internal or external servers on behalf of the vulnerable application. |
| XML External Entity (XXE) Injection | This occurs when external entities are injected into an XML document, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or execution of remote code. |
| Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) | This occurs when an attacker can load a web page's JavaScript data from an external source, allowing them to execute malicious code on the victim's browser. |
| Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) | This occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into a template that is parsed and executed on the server-side. |
