# Free Open Source IP Leak Test | [Demo](https://sircryptic.github.io/Basic-Websites-Portfolio/IP%20Leak%20Test/index.html)

A free open-source web page to check your IP address, location, ISP, and VPN status, built for my web development portfolio.

## Features
- Displays IPv4/IPv6, ISP, city, region, country, timezone, and coordinates.
- Detects VPNs (ProtonVPN, NordVPN and many more).
- Checks for WebRTC leaks (IP or mDNS identifiers).
- Interactive map with IP-based and real geolocation (if permitted).

## Privacy
Collects IP and user-agent for geolocation and WebRTC checks. All processing is client-side, and no data is stored. See [Privacy Notice](https://sircryptic.github.io/Basic-Websites-Portfolio/IP%20Leak%20Test/privacy.html) for details.
